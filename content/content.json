            "Extract uses AI to transform complex geospatial planning documents - including hand written notes - into modern, usable data significantly faster, more consistently, and at lower cost than traditional manual methods.",
            "Manually, it takes 2 hours to convert one planning document. Extract is 30 times faster and 120 times cheaper.",
            "Extract will accelerate our progress toward a complete, consistent national planning database. This enables citizens to instantly see all relevant planning constraints and draw accurate site boundaries - leading to more accurate applications and fewer rejections. This enables councils to save time and money, freeing up capacity for planners to focus on assessing planning applications rather than data wrangling.",
